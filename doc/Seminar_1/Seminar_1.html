			<h1>SEMINARI 1</h1>
			<h2>Requirements elicitation</h2>


			<h3>Task 1: Stakeholders</h3>
			<p>We can distinguish many different types of stakeholders in the project. We differenciate between external and internal people who are concerned within the project. On the one hand we have <b>internal stakeholders</b>, and they are categorized as follows:</p>

			<li><u>Entrepeneurs</u> (or the 3 initial friends): They begin with the idea and have a lot to say about its development.</li>

			<li><u>Investor</u> (or Notoriously Meticulous): He puts the money and have much power to change the course of the project.</li>

			<li><u>Administrators</u>: They are encharged of the users, moderating webpage's content.</li>

			<li><u>Creators</u>: Upload new games developed by other companies or organizations.</li>

			<li><u>Testers</u>: Evaluate new games and earn a limited number of credits for doing it.</li>

			<li><u>Players</u>: Interact with the website content, connecting a client and the game played.</li>

			<p>On the other hand, we have <b>external stakeholders</b> who are able to produce different effects on our site. For instance:</p>

			<li><u>Forums</u>: A community could see decrease its incomes due to our project, thus they would spread bad thoughts about our company.</li>

			<li><u>Hackers</u>: They would be ready to crash our database system or servers where our information is gathered.</li>

			<li><u>Hosting Attendance</u>: They manage everything related with the servers that mantain the system working efficiently.</li>

			<li><u>Marketing Attendance</u>: They are in charge of spreading out as far as they can our site in the net.</li>

			<li><u>Customer Care</u>: They help any user that requires an small lesson about our website.</li>

			<li><u>Web Layout Experts</u>: They design the interface and who users interact with all of its features.</li>

			<li><u>Lawyers</u>: They are in charge of all the bureaucracy related to the website.</li>



			<h3>Task 2: Obscure points</h3>
			<p>There are some points described in the enunciate that we are going to clarify and try to get a good approach.</p>

			<p><b>What advantages should we offer to game creators in order to get their attention?</b>
				<br>Creators are not motivated to upload their games in our website, they do not receive anything in exchange. Since we want a reliable system. we must have a great flow of users. In other case they would prefer to create their own website or join another company in the competency.</br>
			</p>

			<p><b>What are the main methods to get money from publicity?</b>
				<br>A company is not profitable if it does not have an stable income, in internet this is mainly obtained from publicity. Apart from premium accounts and e-mails sent to users as stated, it would be great to manage user's flow in a correct way in order to ensure a minimum earnings.</br>
			</p>

			<p><b>What aspects, apart from tester's job, can we offer to users so they can earn credits and we promote ourselves?</b>
				<br>Users would have a new way to increase their number of credits by motivating their friends to join the site and earning creadits from that. This must be implemented as a referrer system, and it would increase the amount of people that enters to our web, which means more money.</br>
			</p>

			<p><b>How we decide which users can be administrators?</b>
				<br>This is an important aspect, because they must work according to company's objectives. Since administrators have so much power, we should select only those users who have helped in the website's forum. So helpless users, a ranking is needed, will never be administrators. </br>
			</p>

			<p><b>Are players allowed to play the games without becoming members of the community?</b>
				<br>Players should be able to interact with games without becoming members. If we don't do this, we are forcing to sign up on our site in order to play its games. This can be great because we would have more information about all users, but we would be rejecting a lot of people.</br>
			</p>


			<h3>Task 3: Glossary</h3>

			<li><u>Watermark</u>: A common way of identifying images and protecting them from unauthorized use online.</li>
			 
			<li><u>Subscriber</u>: Customer (or maybe not yet) looking to stay informed of all the latest news on the publishing, an author on concrete or a specific topic among other criteria.</li>
			 
			<li><u>Donator</u>: It is a person who pays for something to make it better without expecting anything in return. In this case donations will motivate authors to upload and improve their works. This clarification is important because it can cause confusion as there are many types of donations (donators of organs for example).</li>
			 
			<li><u>Collection</u>: Group of works.</li>
			 
			<li><u>Layout</u> (or designer): Person who is responsible for making the design of digital content related MeltingPot.</li>
			 
			<li><u>Stakeholders</u>: They are the parts that contribute into the project's development.</li>

			<li><u>Client</u>: People who sign up in our website and act either as a player, tester or creator.</li>

			<li><u>Catalog</u>: It refers to the list of games available in the website.</li>

			<li><u>Credit</u>: The money a player is required to pay if he wants to play a game.</li>
